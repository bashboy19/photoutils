* instagramify.py: automatically crops and resize pictures into one (or more pictures if source picture aspect ratio allows) of 4:5 aspect ratio at 1080px by 1350px resolution for Instagram. The number of disired pictures to crop into can be customized by adding "-X" to the file names. eg. to force crop "MyPhoto.JPG" into 3 pictures of 4:5,  change the name to "MyPhoto-3.JPG"
